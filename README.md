# React Snake

> An implementation of the classic arcarde game using React and Node. 

React Snake is an exercise for getting acquainted with the React framework. It was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, which is available [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

The most difficult part of building React Snake was dealing with the clearing and re-drawing of the HTML5 canvas in an efficient manner. At first, the "snake" was implemented as a series of points; Unfortunately this became taxing on the browser as the snake grew over the lifetime of a game. To handle this I reimagined the snake as a series of verticies, stored each vertex, and drew lines between them. This proved a much more efficient way of using the canvas, but added significant complexity to the calculation of collisions â€” tail collisions in particular.
